 Cybersecurity Basics - TryHackMe Walkthrough

> Modules Completed:
- Introduction to Networking
- LANs
- OSI Model
- Introduction to Offensive Security
- Introduction to Defensive Security


## ðŸ“¡ 1. Networking & LANs

### What I Learned:
- The basics of how computers communicate over the internet.
- IP addresses, DNS, routers, and ports.
- The concept of **Local Area Networks (LANs)** and how devices are connected inside homes and organizations.

### Key Concepts:
- IP Addressing (IPv4)
- DNS resolution
- Ports and protocols (HTTP â†’ Port 80, SSH â†’ Port 22)


## 2. OSI Model

### What I Learned:
- The **7 layers** of the OSI model and what happens at each one.
- How data is broken down, transmitted, and rebuilt.

| Layer | Name           | Example                         |
|-------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| 7     | Application    | Web browser (HTTP)              |
| 4     | Transport      | TCP/UDP                         |
| 3     | Network        | IP addresses                    |
| 2     | Data Link      | MAC addresses                   |


## 3. Offensive Security (Red Team)

### What I Learned:
- Offensive security means trying to **hack into systems** to find weaknesses before real attackers do.
- Common methods: Reconnaissance, Exploitation, Privilege Escalation.

### Tools Introduced:
- Nmap
- Metasploit (mentioned)


## 4. Defensive Security (Blue Team)

### What I Learned:
- Blue team = defenders who protect systems and respond to threats.
- Focus on logging, alerting, firewalls, and monitoring.
- Introduction to SIEM tools and intrusion detection.


## Summary:

These introductory rooms helped me understand the **foundations of cybersecurity** from both attacker (red team) and defender (blue team) perspectives.

Next Steps:
- Start learning hands-on tools like Nmap and Wireshark
- Try a beginner-level CTF room
- Build a script to automate simple tasks (like port scanning)
